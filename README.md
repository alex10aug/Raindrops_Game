Raindrops Game
==============

Move the catcher along the bottom of the screen to catch the raindrops that are falling. Your score increases by 1 every time the catcher catches a raindrop. Your missed score increases by 1 every time you miss a raindrop. When your missed score reaches 20, you lose a life. You have 3 lives. Try to catch as many raindrops before you lose! Also, every time the game starts, a rainbow star will come shooting down. If you catch this star, you win the game immediately! :)

*Good luck and have fun!*

**BUGS:**

**1.** the star sometimes goes off the screen when it is coming down

**2.** clicking the mouse always resets the game (could be annoying if you didn't want to reset)
